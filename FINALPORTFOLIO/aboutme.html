                <p>
                 In my art I explore various themes surrounding my passion for aquatics and my own cultural identity. As a first generation immigrant, who grew up in an area with little cultural diversity, I struggled with my own self identity with my culture. I was born in Cebu City in the Philippines, and moved to the United States when I was 1   year old. Over the years, Iâ€™ve grown more proud of my heritage and my ethnic features. I have worked in various traditional mediums and am currently focused on my digital works. A theme that tends to recur and I enjoy exploring in my works are cultural, whimsical, and aquatic themes. I have a long history with swimming and the ocean, as I was part of competitive swim teams/clubs since the age of 6. I also have a deep love for the ocean and its creatures. The mystery and beauty of the sea draw me in and my love for it is seen throughout my pieces. Currently, I have my associates degree in studio art from the College of the Sequoias, and I am currently enrolled in the digital media arts program at San Jose State University.
